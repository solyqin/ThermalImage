    <p>    i) changes to the Program, and</p>
    <p>    ii) additions to the Program;</p>
    <p>
        where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
        distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
        Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
        acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
        the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
        conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
        derivative works of the Program.
    </p>
    <p>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.</p>

        Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
        reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
        distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such

        Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
        Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
        Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
        This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
        Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
        addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
        Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
        which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

    <p>
        c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
        to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
        Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
        property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
        Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
        intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
        rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
        responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
        For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
        distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
        before distributing the Program.
    </p>
    <p>
        d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
        copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set
        forth in this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>3. REQUIREMENTS</p>
    <p>
        A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
        own license agreement, provided that:
    </p>
    <p>    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p>
    <p>    b) its license agreement:</p>
    <p>
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
        conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
        non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
        fitness for a particular purpose;
    </p>
    <p>
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
        damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
        damages, such as lost profits;
    </p>
    <p>
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
        by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
    </p>
    <p>
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or
        through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
    </p>
    <p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>
    <p>    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>
    <p>    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. </p>
    <p>
        Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
        Program.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
        any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
        originator of the Contribution.
    </p>
    <p>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</p>
    <p>
        Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
        respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
        intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
        includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
        which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
        a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
        Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
        every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
        and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
        actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
        extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
        connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
        offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
        relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
        to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
        Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
        control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
        related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
        any such claim at its own expense.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
        offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
        Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
        related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
        Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
        Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
        Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
        requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
        Contributor must pay those damages.
    </p>
    <p>5. NO WARRANTY</p>
    <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
        "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
        IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
        Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
        distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
        rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
        program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
        programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
    </p>
    <p>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</p>
    <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
        CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
        SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
        PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
        STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
        OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
        GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    </p>
    <p>7. GENERAL</p>
    <p>
        If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
        law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
        terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
        provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
        provision valid and enforceable.
    </p>
    <p>
        If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
        a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
        lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
        under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
        addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
        itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
        infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
        Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
    </p>
    <p>
        All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
        comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
        not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
        such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
        Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
        reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
        and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
        survive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
        order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
        modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
        publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
        No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
        IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
        as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
        Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
        Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
        under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
        is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
        Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
        2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
        intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
        expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
        expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
        intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
        Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
        after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
        any resulting litigation.

    <h3>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h3>
    <p>
        Version 2.1, February 1999
    </p><pre>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]</pre>

    <h3>Preamble</h3>

    <p>
        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
        freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
        Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
        free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
    </p>
    <p>
        This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
        specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
        Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
        can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
        this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
        strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
        not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
        you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
        for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
        it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
        it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
        these things.
    </p>
    <p>
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
        distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
        rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
        you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
        or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
        you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
        code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
        complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
        with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
        it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    </p>
    <p>
        We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
        library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
        permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
    </p>
    <p>
        To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
        there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
        modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
        that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
        author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
        introduced by others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
        any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
        effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
        restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
        any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
        consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
        ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
        is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
        this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
        libraries into non-free programs.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
        a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
        combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
        General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
        entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
        Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
        the library.
    </p>
    <p>
        We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
        does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
        Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
        of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
        are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
        libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
        special circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
        encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
        a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
        allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
        library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
        case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
        software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
        programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
        free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
        non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
        operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
        system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
        users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
        linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
        that program using a modified version of the Library.
    </p>
    <p>
        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
        "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
        former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
        be combined with the library in order to run.
    </p>

    <h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
        DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>
	
    <p>
        <strong>0.</strong>
        This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
        program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
        other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
        this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
        Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    </p>
    <p>
        A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
        prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
        (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
        which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
        Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
        copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
        portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
        straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
        included without limitation in the term "modification".)
    </p>
    <p>
        "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
        making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
        all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
        interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
        and installation of the library.
    </p>
    <p>
        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
        covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
        running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
        such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
        on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
        writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
        and what the program that uses the Library does.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>1.</strong>
        You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
        complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
        you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
        appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
        all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
        warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
        Library.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
        and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
        fee.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2.</strong>
        You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
        of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
        distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
        above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>a)</strong>
            The modified work must itself be a software library.</li>
        <li><strong>b)</strong>
            You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
            stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li>

        <li><strong>c)</strong>
            You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
            charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</li>

        <li><strong>d)</strong>
            If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
            table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
            the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
            is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
            in the event an application does not supply such function or
            table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
            its purpose remains meaningful.
            <p>
                (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
                a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
                application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
                application-supplied function or table used by this function must
                be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
                root function must still compute square roots.)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
        sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
        reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
        this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
        distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same
        sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
        distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
        permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
        each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
        rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
        the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
        based on the Library.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
        the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
        or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
        this License.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>3.</strong>
        You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
        License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
        this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
        that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
        instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
        ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
        that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
        these notices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
        that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
        subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
    </p>
    <p>
        This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
        the Library into a program that is not a library.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>4.</strong>
        You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
        derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
        under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
        it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
        must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
        medium customarily used for software interchange.
    </p>
    <p>
        If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
        source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
        distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
        compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>5.</strong>
        A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
        Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
        linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
        work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
        therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
        creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
        contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
        library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
        Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
        that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
        derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
        Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
        linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
        threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
        structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
        functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
        file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
        work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
        Library will still fall under Section 6.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
        distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
        Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
        whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>6.</strong>
        As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
        link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
        work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
        under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
        modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
        engineering for debugging such modifications.
    </p>
    <p>
        You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
        Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
        this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
        during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
        copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
        directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
        of these things:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete
            corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library
            including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
            distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
            executable linked with the Library, with the complete
            machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
            and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and
            then relink to produce a modified executable containing the
            modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the
            contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily
            be able to recompile the application to use the modified
            definitions.)</li>

        <li><strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism
            for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that
            (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the
            user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into
            the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
            version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
            modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the
            work was made with.</li>

        <li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer,
            valid for at least three years, to give the same user the
            materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
            than the cost of performing this distribution.</li>

        <li><strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by
            offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent
            access to copy the above specified materials from the same
            place.</li>

        <li><strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received
            a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user
            a copy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
        Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
        reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
        the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
        normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
        components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
        which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
        the executable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
        restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
        accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
        use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
        distribute.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work
        based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with
        other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
        such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of
        the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
        otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy
            of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other
            library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of
            the Sections above.</li>

        <li><strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined
            library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the
            Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
            form of the same work.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,
        or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
        License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link
        with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically
        terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have
        received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
        their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
        compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>9.</strong>
        You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
        signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
        distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
        prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
        modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
        Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
        all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
        the Library or works based on it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>10.</strong>
        Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
        Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
        original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
        subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
        restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
        You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
        this License.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>11.</strong>
        If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
        infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
        conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
        otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
        excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
        distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
        License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
        may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
        license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
        all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
        the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
        refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
    </p>
    <p>
        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
        particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
        and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
        patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
        such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
        integrity of the free software distribution system which is
        implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
        through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
        to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
        impose that choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
        be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>12.</strong>
        If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
        certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
        original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
        an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
        so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
        excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
        written in the body of this License.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>13.</strong>
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
        Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
        specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
        "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
        conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
        the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
        license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
        the Free Software Foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>14.</strong>
        If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
        programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
        write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
        copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
        Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
        decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
        of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
        and reuse of software generally.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>15.</strong>
        BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
        WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
        EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
        OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
        IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
        LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
        THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>16.</strong>
        IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
        WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
        AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
        FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
        LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
        RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
        FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
        SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGES.
